# MLLogisticRegression

The code implements Logistic Regression on a bayesian network with data containing missing values. 

LRIgnoreMissing.m handles missing data by ignoring all the data points with missing values

LRModeMissng.m handles missing data by replace missing values with mode over the training data.

LRAccuracy.m calculates accuracy of both the implementations above.
